        <!-- Information on different reasons why a dog is considered a man's bestfriend-->
    <h3>"A man's best friend" is a phrase that is pretty commonly said. It describes how dogs show their loyalty and companionship.</h3>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Dog's are considered a man's bestfriend because of their personalities. Dog's are the type of animal that know when you are sad or upset. When they notice something is wrong they are the one's to jump up on you and give you a lot of dog kisses. They wil sit with you while you watch a movie and cuddle up next to you. All dogs make you feel calm, relaxed, comfortable, and safe.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All types of dogs can make you really happy and there is a scientific reasoning behind that. When you interact with a dog your brain releases high amounts of oxytocin which is commonly called the "cuddle-chemical. Oxytocin reduces things that bother you such as stress, anxiety, and anger. It makes you feel calm and relaxed which is so much better than feeling stressed.
        <br />
        <br />
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As you may know dogs are very loyal and you may be wondering how and why. Dogs have always been pack animals meaning they have always been able to interact with different animals. Dogs are very loyal to humans because they are like body gurads and they begin to grow very close with their owners.
